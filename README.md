# GaussianFilter
Manual algorithm from the Open CV program whose function is to reduce noise and produce a smoothing effect on images or matrices

for input, it must use a matrix (can't image)

I implemented the Gaussian algorithm on Python so that you can understand how the Gaussian works manually. for the padding part, I use the number 0. And for dividing the multiplication results, I use the round function
